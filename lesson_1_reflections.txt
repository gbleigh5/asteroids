How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It stated the lines where changes occured and displayed the two versions

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would be useful in finding bugs and reverting to old working verisons

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
    You can control the commit size

    Cons:
    You may forget to save at the appropriate time

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git was built to track repositories (with programmers in mind) while the
    others were built for single file tracking.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the entire history of the repository while git diff shows the
    changes between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I'm sure I can always get my previous versions anytime

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Move all my existing projects to git
